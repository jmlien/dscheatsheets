# Data Structures Cheatsheet for CS 310

# Conceptural Representations

- Linear vs. Tree vs. Graph
- Linear structures include
  - Linked lists
  - Array lists
  - They are a subset of tree structures.
- Tree structures include 
  - Binary tree
  - Binary search tree
  - M-ary tree
  - Self-balance tree
    - AVL tree
    - Red-black tree
    - splay tree
  - B-tree
  - They are a subset of graphs.
- Graph structures include 
  - (Un-)Directed graph
  - (Un-)Weigted graph
  - Directed Acyclic graph (DAG)
  - Spare vs Dense graph
  - Bipartite graph (did not cover this in CS 310)
  - ... (many more)

# Internal Representations

- Linked-List Based
  - Linear: queues, stacks, linked lists, separate chaining (HashSet, HashMap), deque
  - Tree: BST, AVL, Red-black, splay, B-tree, M-ary tree
  - Graph: adjacency list
  
- Array-List Based
  - Linear: circular queues, stacks, separate chaining (HashSet, HashMap), closed hashing, 
  - Tree: B-tree, heap (complete trees), union-find structure (disjoint sets), any tree structures (but will waste a lot of space)
  - Graph: adjacency matrix

# Foundamental Operations

- Linear: add, remove, find, access, sort, merge
- Tree: add, remove, find, balance (ensuring a bound on the tree height), reducing tree to linear structures (traversal, sort), merge
- Graph: reducing graph to tree structures (MST, DFS, BFS, Shortest path tree, Spanning tree...), add/remove edges/vretices, merge (trivial), no sorting unless the graph is a DAG (so called topological sort or linearization of graph).
